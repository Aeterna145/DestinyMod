General rule of thumb:
Do not blatantly steal / rig code for your own mod or mods. You can use my code as a general reference (how good / efficient it actually is doesn't matter).
Same rule goes for sprites or any other media in this repo (music, sounds, etc.)
Punishment for doing so will be me spamming you till you die.
Other than that, feel free to have at it.
